Step 1: Install Django
First, I  install Django. 
pip install django
Step 2: Create a new Django project

django-admin startproject portfolio_project
This will create a new directory called portfolio with the basic files for a Django project.

Step 3: Create a new Django app
python manage.py startapp portfolio_app

Step 4: Extend the Django user model
To add further details to the Django user model, I created a new model that extends the built-in User model.

Step 5: Create views for user profile pages
Next, you need to create views for the user profile pages. In the portfolio_app, create a new file called views.py 
Step 6: Create templates for user portfolio_app
Next, I created templates for the user portfolio_app. In the portfolio_app, create a new directory called templates and within templates I added base.html,profiles.html, edit_profiles.html

Lastly I created bonus requirements (test cases, Cl Intergrations etc
